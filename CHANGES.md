## Version 0.2.0

1. New method getResolver() to export a new resolver class instance.
2. require() and resolve() now take an optional options object.  Options allow use of user defined resolver and root directory.
3. Calculation of root directory improved.

## Version 0.1.0

1. Now exports one function with other methods attached.  So: loader.require() becomes loader().
